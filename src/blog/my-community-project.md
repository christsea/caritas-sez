On **April 15, 2025**, our team of 50 volunteers gathered at **Anse Police Beach** for a community cleanup. Here’s what we accomplished:

## Key Results

- ✅ **200kg of trash** removed (60% plastic waste).
- ✅ **500+ locals** educated about marine conservation.
- ✅ **12 local businesses** partnered for future initiatives.

## How We Organized the Event

1. **Recruitment**: Promoted via social media and flyers.
2. **Logistics**: Provided gloves, bags, and recycling bins.
3. **Education**: Held a short workshop on plastic pollution.

> "This cleanup showed how small actions create ripple effects."

## Lessons Learned
