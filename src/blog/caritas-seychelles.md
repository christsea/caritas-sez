## **History & Mission**

Founded in **1975** by **Bishop Felix Paul**, Caritas Seychelles began with a simple mission: to provide **food, clothing, and shelter** to the poor. Today, it has grown into a multifaceted organization addressing:

- **Education**: Academic skills training for youth employability.
- **Disaster relief**: Drought/flood response and long-term recovery.
- **Spiritual support**: Moral guidance for families in crisis.

## **Key Programs**

1. **Food & Clothing Drives**  
   Distributed through local parishes, serving hundreds monthly.
2. **Medical Assistance**  
   Funding for overseas treatments unavailable in Seychelles.
3. **Youth Empowerment**  
   Vocational training to improve job prospects.
