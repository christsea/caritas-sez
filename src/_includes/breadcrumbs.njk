{# 
  Breadcrumbs snippet:
  - Splits the current page URL into segments.
  - Generates links for each segment.
  - If the URL is just the homepage ("/"), it shows only "Home".
  We start by grabbing the current page URL from the page.url variable.

The URL is split on / and any empty segments (from leading/trailing slashes) are removed.

If there are segments, we loop through them. For each segment, we append it to a cumulative path (path) and generate a link.

The filter | replace("-", " ") | title is optionalâ€”it converts hyphens to spaces and then title-cases the segment so it looks nicer in the breadcrumb.

If no segments exist (i.e. the homepage), it just outputs a single "Home" link.

{% set segments = url.split('/') | reject("equalto", "") | list %}
