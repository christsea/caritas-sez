  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>
    Caritas Seychelles was established in 1975 by Bishop Felix Paul with the mission to assist the poor and marginalized populations by providing essential human needs such as food, clothing, and shelter. Over the years, Caritas Seychelles has expanded its scope of activities to include a variety of humanitarian and social services from assisting individuals and families who are struggling to meet their basic needs with food and clothing to providing educational activities to providing financial assistance to individuals going abroad for medical treatment not available in the country. Caritas Seychelles has also expanded its activities to include the provision of academic skills to young people in order to empower them to obtain a better job prospect. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Caritas Seychelles also engages in various programmes aimed at improving the lives of those in need by providing life-saving aid during natural disasters like droughts and floods; offering food and clothing to impoverished individuals; delivering spiritual and moral support to families facing challenges.
  </p> 
  <p>
    Caritas Seychelles operates under the catholic church and is a member of Caritas Internationalis and Caritas Africa, which connects it with a broader network focused on humanitarian aid across Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
    The work of the organization is guided by a board under the leadership of Bishop Allain Harrel with the help of over 200 volunteers who contribute their time and skills to support its mission.
  </p>
  <p>
    Caritas Seychelles is funded by the local community through collection and distribution of donations through local parishes and organization of events to gather resources for those most in need. Most of the activities of Caritas Seychelles is done at Parish level where a committee is formed by members of the parish and its priest.
