<h2>Award for Emergency</h2>
<p>
  During the night of 7th December 2024, Seychelles was shaken by an explosion of dynamite at a construction quarry in the east of the island of Mahe.  Over hundred houses were damaged, some completely destroyed.  Thanks to God amongst the casualties there were no lost of lives, although some victims suffered injuries, some seriously.
</p>
<p>
  Also, during that same night there was heavy rain that resulted in landslides and overflow of rivers and drains around the island.  There were three victims of the landslides who lost their lives.
</p>
<p> 
  During the time of disaster, Caritas Seychelles extended its services to the communities.  Some members were engaged at the Centre helping in the sorting and distribution of necessities to the people. Several members from parishes groups visited the families affected at their homes.  Some 35 families were visited and assisted in various forms.  Some were referred to different organisations and experts for follow-up.   Food and other necessities were distributed to those in need.
</p>
<p>
  We also assisted over 100 with clothes and other support at the facilities they were placed in whilst the Government, with the assistance of several other institutions, businesses and church organisations assisted with lodging and other needs.
</p>
<p>
  The Caritas Seychelles youths also played a very important role in helping the children overcome their trauma.  In collaboration with other agencies, they organised several activities at the facilities, such as musical shows, face painting, organised visits, to name a few.
</p>
<p>
  The government was very appreciative of the Caritas Seychelles actions.  Certificates were presented to participants by the Minister of Social Affairs.
</p>
<p> 
  On 29th June 2024 President Wavel Ramkalawan presented Caritas Seychelles with the Pride of Seychelles Award for its exceptional response to the December 7, 2023 disasters.
